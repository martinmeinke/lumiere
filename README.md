# Lumiere
Is a minimal-user-interface clock a that doesn't disturbe your sleep    

## No interfaces
- No buttons
- No charging port 
- Automatic timezone configuration (GPS-based)

##
If you are operating without a battery, don't forget to `#define BATTERY_POWERED 0` in [main.cpp](main.cpp).
This will disable going to deep sleep if the battery voltage drops too low.


## Why?
- 

## How?
- Keep sync via gps


## Future 
- battery indicator?
- out-of-sync indicator?
- don't drain battery if GPS unavailable
